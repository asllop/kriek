# Kriek
_Lexicon Oriented Programming Language_

## Introduction

The Forth programming language is probably one of the most idiosyncratic and powerful Memes in computing history. When it appeared in the 70â€™s it was revolutionary, and all the underlying concepts still remain valuable and contemporary, but some of its details may look a bit aged if we inspect it with the optics of present state-of-the-art computer programming. A handful of nice projects appeared over the years, Factor being the most prominent, following the path traced by Forth and adding modern features. These languages include things like classes, functional operators, garbage collection, complex data primitives, etc. But in my opinion, they lose part of the essence of Forth. In contrast, **Kriek** pursues simplicity, and instead of borrowing concepts from other programming philosophies, it rests upon the set of tools and ideas that originally backed Forth: It extends and delves into the notion of **Lexicon**, which proved to be powerful, compact, and flexible. For this reason, I call Kriek a **Lexicon Oriented Programming Language**.

Kriek received influences from all the programming languages I ever used (and liked), but clearly the strongest ones are:

- Forth: 90% of it!
- Factor: vocabularies inspired lexicons.
- Rust: traits inspired lexicon unions.
- Racket: lists inspired nested stacks.
- Swift: automatic reference counting.
